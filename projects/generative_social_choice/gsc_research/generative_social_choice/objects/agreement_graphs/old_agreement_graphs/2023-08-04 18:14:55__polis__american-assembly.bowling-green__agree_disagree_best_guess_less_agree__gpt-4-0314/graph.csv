comments,More parking downtown.  There are too many reserved spaces which should be available in the evening.,"City/county leaders should be cautious of ""build it and they will come"" mentality for growth and development.",The lack of leadership regarding adequate planning and zoning in BG is discouraging. Law enforcement in Bowling Green and Warren county needs more minority representation Downtown at the square and adjacent areas should be a pedestrian mall,Bowling Green needs a stronger separation of church-mosque-temple and state.,BG police should improve officer training and should be held accountable for abuse of power.,When the city tears up lawns with projects they should be required to do what it takes so that lawns are same quality they were before.,"Bowling Green needs Community Enrichment Classes that include woodworking, welding, gardening and general home beautification for hobbyist.","Warren county needs to be ""wet"". The city is wet but the county is dry.","I feel Bowling Green could benefit with an additional ambulance service.  Quicker response, and possibly a lower payment when used.","Local government, for profit and non profits should work together on housing and economic equality Minimum wage required for businesses to receive tax credits should be raised to a living wage City/County schools should have a minimum one year classroom for immigrant and refugee students so they can learn english, culture and laws","Traffic flow on Cavemill Rd during peek hours (3pm - 5pm) The entrance to Natcher Elementary and Cavemill Rd should consider putting a ""red / green"" light there between the hours of 3:30-4:30. The traffic intersection at Scottsville Rd and Pascoe Blvd needs some immediate attention as far as congestion.  It's very unsafe.",BG needs more Summer weekend festivals/activities,Fireworks use in residential areas is out of control with no police presence to enforce the already in place restrictions.,"Convict Slim Nash of his DUI, it's absurd he got it dismissed Need new schools in Warren County to keep up with population growth, CTE is falling down, Drakes and Greenwood high are way overcrowded",BG can’t compete with Nashville or Louisville for young professionals Please increase more family friendly activities Bowling Grewn needs it own permanent ice skating/hockey rink Bowling Green needs a health food store,New home zoning should be for single family dwellings rather than multi-family units (apartments).,Pass a No animals on chains in the county. Pass a no animals in a hot car ordinance. Allow parents that take their kids out of public schools to use that money in a private school. Pass an ordinance that requires pet owners to pay a fee if their pets are not fixed. Stop pan handling Build a homeless park w/tiny homes so they can live & not suffer. There should also be a main house to can receive/organize donations A fine if your cat or dog is picked up as a stray and is not spayed or neutered in the county.,"Oversight committees for projects such as TIF. Elected officials should not be able to sit on unelected boards. Unelected school board officials should not have the power to create, add, or increase ""school taxes"". Local elected government officials should not be able to hold a seat and also be on the TIF board or other unelected boards.",The feeder road at Shive Lane and Scottsville Road need to be closed off. It is very dangerous.,Leash laws should be more strictly enforced in both the city and county
